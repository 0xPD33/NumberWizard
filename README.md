# NumberWizard
NumberWizard Console Game to get back into C#

Well I've been quite busy working a day-job. 
I didn't take the time to program every day due to the lack of motivation and self-discipline.

So over the course of some weeks I didn't touch anything related to programming.
Big mistake because now I have to learn lots of stuff again.

When I did touch it, I didn't upload anything to GitHub (I have some private projects).
For example: I started working on a website with HTML and CSS and completed a Contact Book Application in WPF.

The next thing on my hitlist will probably be: remaking my text-editor (PadPad) in WPF and add the features I wanted to add.

Stay tuned.
